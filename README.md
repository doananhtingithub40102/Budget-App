### What Is React?

React is a javascript library for building user interfaces.

It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code that can be reusable called ``component``.

A ``component`` takes in parameters, called ``props`` (short for “properties”). Passing ``props`` is how information flows in React apps, from parents to children ``component``.

The ``render`` method returns a description (HTML tags or components) of what you want to see on the screen.

When data of ``props`` changes, React will efficiently update and re-render our components.

### Making an Interactive Component

Handling event from user's interactive. For example:

```
<button onClick={() => console.log("click")}>Click me</button>
```
